Although elven druids are mastered every circle, they hold the ancient way of treesinging close to their heart. These druids tend to the green growing things of their communities above all else, from new sprouts in the fertile spring soil to towering redwoods and ancient, magical trees as old as the land itself. These druids travel between elven communities—most often farflung wood and wild elf settlements—helping their people live in harmony with the trees that shield them. Many hold Rillifane Rallathil sacred and even proclaim to hear the Many-Branched god in the rustling of leaves.",
