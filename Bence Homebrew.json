During the Dawn War, both were fatally wounded by Primordials, their own godly essences both so damaged that their death would be final and permanent. To save themselves, they both fused into the one god Sylagar. Even with their now conjoined form and identity, each of the two twins' personality shines through, alternating between night and day. Sylagar is always considered the god of duality, mischief, and whimsy... during the day he is also a god of joy and hope, but during the night he trades those latter two domains for fear and carnage.",
