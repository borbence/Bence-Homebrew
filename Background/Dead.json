People who have died often live in one of these extremes, experiencing life to the fullest or becoming fixated on a single goal that gives their new life meaning.",

					"How did you die? It probably wasn't of old age. Spells like raise dead can bring back those who die before old age takes them, but after dying of old age there is almost no magic which can bring a person back to life. Was it combat? An accident? A disease?",
					"How long were you dead? Spells like true resurrection allow a PC to return from death after as many as 200 years. How has the world changed politically, technologically, and culturally since your death? What remains of your family, friends, and personal life?",
					"What was your period of death like? Did you spend time in the glory of eternal battle is Ysgard? Were you enjoying the paradise of Elysium? Were you being tortured in the Nine Hells or Abyss? Do you remember nothing from that time?",
					"Maybe you didn't completely pass on, but lived life as an undead, wayward soul such as a ghost or vampire. Why did you become such a being? What acts did you commit that you now regret? Who still thinks of you as a monster?",
					"Finally someone brought you back. Who was it? Why? Maybe it was to face an old enemy. Maybe it was a loved one who searched for a long time and spent all their resources to bring you back. Maybe you were brought back for a secret only you knew. How did this person bring you back? Was it straight forward magic? What about a spell like reincarnate, which could bring your spirit back in the body of a different humanoid race? Or maybe it was some other magic that has a more sinister secret."
